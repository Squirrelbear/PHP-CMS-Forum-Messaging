# PHP CMS Forum Messaging
 
A PHP based site with support for messaging, shopping, forums, etc. 

This collection of source code is mostly content I wrote in 2008 provide users forum/messaging functionality with a site. Including uploading and management of files. Note that the code does not conform to more recent SQL protection against injection and should not be used without modification. The databases it connects to are local files so if the code was to be updated it would make sense to change all those associations to use a live web database for security too.
